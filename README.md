This is a walkthrough of setting the [Couchbase Operator](https://blog.couchbase.com/introducing-couchbase-operator/) up on [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).  

## Background

EKS is in preview.  Your account must be whitelisted in order to use it.

You'll also probably want a copy of the documentation.  If you're whitelisted you'll get access to that.  There's a Slack channel too.
